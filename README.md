What is the goal/purpose:
=========================

MediacenterJS is/will be a mediacenter like for instance XBMC but based 100% on frontend techniques and languages (HTML5/CSS/Javascript).
The backend is based on Nodejs/ExpressJS 3x with jade templates producing easy to use code. 
The goal is to make it possible to add an 'app' to MCJS even with limited knowlegde of said frontend techniques. 
An 'app' in this case is basically a wrapper for a feature you can use within MCJS.

On the wishlist for MCJS are UPNP, fast transcoding and crossbrowser compatibility.

This application will run on Windows and Linux based systems. 
There will be a specific Linux distro for raspberry pi using a kiosk, debian distro.

Basic featurelist:

* Multiple apps like youtube, weather stopify etc.
* Movie database with information and playback
* Music database with information and playback
* TV show database with information and playback 
* Easy to use app framework
