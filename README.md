mediacenterjs
=============

A HTML/CSS/Javascipt (NodeJs) based Mediacenter

UTF+f28f Status: unstable WIP

What is the goal/purpose:
MediacenterJS is/will be a mediacenter like for instance XBMC but based 100% on frontend techniques(HTML5/CSS/Javascript) and languages.
The backend is based on Nodejs/ExpressJS 3x with jade templates producing easy to use and code for end product. 
The goal is to make it possible to add a 'app' to MCJS even with limited knowlegde of said frontend techniques.
Asside from that, due to the use of node, MCJS is/will be very fast and highly customizable.

The actual playing of the video will be possible with different utilities. 
If using a smart TV, a upnp connection will be established. If using an standard tv with, for instance Rasberry PI, VLC wil be used to play the video. 

This application will run on Windows and Linux based systems. 
There will be a specific Linux distro for raspberry pi using a kiosk, debian distro.
