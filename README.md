mediacenterjs
=============

A HTML/CSS/Javascipt (NodeJs) based Mediacenter

Status: unstable WIP

What is the endgame:
MediacenterJS is/will be a mediacenter like for instance XBMC but based 100% on frontend techniques(HTML5/CSS/Javascript) and languages.
The backend is based on Nodejs/ExpressJS 3x with jade templates producing easy to use and code for end product. 
The goal is to make it possible to add a 'app' to MCJS even with limited knowlegde of said frontend techniques.
